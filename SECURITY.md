## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue in Code Morningstar, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security details to: [your-security-email@example.com]
3. Include as much information as possible:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Status Update**: Weekly until resolved
- **Fix Release**: Target 30 days for critical issues

### Disclosure Policy

- We practice responsible disclosure
- We'll work with you to understand and fix the issue
- Public disclosure only after fix is available
- Credit will be given to reporter (unless requested otherwise)

## Security Considerations

### API Security

#### Authentication
- API key authentication required for sensitive endpoints
- Use strong, unique API keys
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Store API keys securely (environment variables, secret management)

#### Input Validation
- All inputs validated using Pydantic models
- SQL injection prevention (when database is added)
- XSS prevention in frontend
- File upload restrictions

#### Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting in production
- Monitor for unusual API usage patterns
- Set appropriate limits per endpoint

### Model Security

#### Model Files
- Validate model file integrity
- Restrict model file access permissions
- Monitor model file changes
- Use trusted model sources only

#### Generated Content
- Content filtering for inappropriate outputs
- Monitoring for malicious prompt injection
- Rate limiting for generation requests
- User input sanitization

### Infrastructure Security

#### Environment Variables
- Use `.env` files for local development only
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use proper secret management in production
- Encrypt sensitive configuration data

#### Network Security
- Use HTTPS in production
- Configure CORS policies appropriately
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Monitor network traffic

### Frontend Security

#### XSS Prevention
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Validate API responses before display
- Escape special characters in HTML

#### CSRF Prevention
- Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- Use SameSite cookie attributes
- Validate referrer headers
- Implement double-submit cookies

## Secure Configuration

### Production Checklist

#### Backend Security
- [ ] Change default API keys
- [ ] Enable HTTPS
- [ ] Configure CORS properly
- [ ] Set up rate limiting
- [ ] Enable request logging
- [ ] Use secure session management
- [ ] Implement input validation
- [ ] Set up error handling (no sensitive info in errors)
- [ ] Configure security headers
- [ ] Use secure communication protocols

#### Frontend Security
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy
- [ ] Use HTTPS for all resources
- [ ] Validate all user inputs
- [ ] Sanitize displayed content
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Use secure cookie settings
- [ ] Enable HSTS headers
- [ ] Implement subresource integrity

#### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Use strong passwords
- [ ] Enable two-factor authentication
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Regular security scanning
- [ ] Monitor system logs
- [ ] Backup data securely
- [ ] Implement access controls
- [ ] Use least privilege principle

### Environment Configuration

#### Development
```env
# Development settings
DEBUG=true
MOCK_MODE=true
API_KEY=dev-key-change-in-production
CORS_ORIGINS=["http://localhost:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:3000"]
```

#### Production
```env
# Production settings (use secret management)
DEBUG=false
MOCK_MODE=false
API_KEY=${SECRET_API_KEY}
CORS_ORIGINS=["https://yourdomain.com"]
DATABASE_URL=${SECRET_DATABASE_URL}
```

## Dependencies Security

### Regular Updates
- Monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Update dependencies regularly
- Use `safety check` for Python packages
- Review dependency licenses

### Vulnerability Scanning
```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
safety check -r backend/requirements.txt

# Security linting
bandit -r backend/

# Check for updates
pip list --outdated
```

### Supply Chain Security
- Pin dependency versions
- Verify package integrity
- Use official package repositories
- Review dependency changes

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Process

1. **Detection**
   - Monitor logs for suspicious activity
   - Set up automated alerts
   - Regular security assessments

2. **Assessment**
   - Evaluate severity and impact
   - Determine affected systems
   - Document incident details

3. **Containment**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Prevent further damage
   - Preserve evidence

4. **Eradication**
   - Remove threat from environment
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Update security measures

5. **Recovery**
   - Restore normal operations
   - Verify system integrity
   - Monitor for recurrence

6. **Lessons Learned**
   - Document incident response
   - Update procedures
   - Improve security measures
